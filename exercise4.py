# Show how a list is made in python. Make a list called a_list
# that contains the following values: "a", 2, "b", 4.




# Show how list indexing works in python. How would you specify the 
# "a" string in the list using indexing?
# Show it in action.


# Use list slicing to just show the 2 and "b" part of the list.
# Show it in action.



# What list method would remove the last member of the list ie 4
# The method would be acessed using the dot oporator (.).
# Show it in action.

# What method would you use to work out the lenght of the list.
# Show it in action.


# Domonstate how you would add the number 10 to the list.



# Another list called another_list contains:4, 4, 4. 
# How would you combine both of these lists.



# How would you use indexing to access the word yes in the following
# list structure? Show the result.
the_list = [1,[2,"yes"],5]


# Make a python dictionary with a key called "akey" and a value 10.
# Call this dictionary a_dict



# Demonstrate how you would use the dictionary to access the value
# assigned to the key "akey"



# How would you make a new entry in the a_dict dictionary with a 
# key "akey2" and a value of 15?




# What is the dictionary method (dot oporator) that returns a list
# of all the keys in the dictionary. Demonstrate how it works with
# the a_dict dictionary.


# Can you have numbers as keys in a dictionary?


# Can a dictionary store lists? If so can you demonstrate how this would
# work with an example?
