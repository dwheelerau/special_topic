# special topic exercise 2
# working with strings
##################

# In python how would you assign the string a to the variable a
# Show your result below
a = "a"

# Repeat this with b, assign the string b to a variable b?
b = "b"

# What is the result of adding the variable a and b together?
# Assign this to a variable c and print the result
c = a + b

# What is the result of multiplying a by b
an error! Cant mutiply strings

# Assign a string repressenting the number 1 to a varibale called
# num1. ie num1 = 1. Do the same for num2 = "10".
# What is the result of num1 + num2?



# How would you force python to make the above result equal to 11
# without changing the vaiables a and b in any way? ie a and b
# should still be strings after the calculation is made.



# What special function would you call to convert 1 into a string?


# you can use string methods directly on the string using the dot (.)
# operator. Use the upper() method on the a variable to make it uppercase
# Show how you did this below.



# What would be the string method I would use to remove the spaces at the
# end of the variable below:
line = " hello world "


# The above method does not perfrom an 'in place change', so printing
# the varaibale line will still show spaces. How would you fix this
# so that the string assigned to the varibale line was actually modifed?
# Hint its just about asignment.



# Now that the variable line has no spaces at the start and end
# What method would you use to replace the 'o' characters with
# the string "eeeeee"?



# Fix the following statement so that it prints the line below
# Hello world nice to meet you!
person = world
greeting = Hello

print "% % nice to meet you" % (person, greeting)
