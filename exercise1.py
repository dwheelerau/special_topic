a = 10
b = 10000

# show how to add these together, assign the result to a varible and 
# print the result
c = a + b
print c

# multiple a and b assign the result to a varibale and print
c = a * b
print c

# divide a and b and assign the result to a varibable and print
c = a / b
print c

# Question 1
# Did the division work? If not show how you would modify
# the variable a and b so that if you divide them you 
# get the correct answer ie: 0.001?
# show your answer below


# In python how would you raise the variable 'a' to the power of 10?
# show this below.


# in a single line calculate the result of a+b that is then multipled by b
