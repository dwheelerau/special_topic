# Use a python for loop to loop through this list
# [1,2,3,4,5]
# Show this below.



# Use the same loop, but this time setup a counter that goes up by 1 
# each loop. ie At the end print counter should return 5.




# Using the same loop, but this time create a varible called s
# to which you add the number from eachloop. 
# So the first loop s will be 1, the next loop s will be 1 + 2=3, then 3+3,
# then 6 + 4 etc.
# Show this below.



# Using the same loop, include an if else clause to only print the number
# 4. Show this below.



# Make a list containing the numbers 1 to 100 using a for loop.
# Hint, setup an empty list, then loop through a the result 
# of range(1,101). Each loop add this number to the list.
